# Decision-Making Guide

How to use research findings to make informed decisions for your codebase.

## Research Philosophy

**Why Comprehensive Research Matters:**

This skill produces research specifically to enable **informed decision-making** and **deep understanding of complex topics**. Research is not just information gathering—it's a systematic process of:

1. **Weighing different ideas against each other** to find the best solution for your specific context
2. **Understanding complex topics** through multiple perspectives and conflicting viewpoints
3. **Making evidence-based decisions** by synthesizing academic rigor with practical insights
4. **Navigating tradeoffs** by explicitly seeking and analyzing conflicting approaches

**Deep research is essential when:**
- Making architecture or technology decisions that will impact your codebase long-term
- Understanding complex topics that require multiple perspectives
- Evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches
- Needing evidence-based recommendations for your specific context
- Facing conflicting advice or unclear best practices

**The research process enables:**
- **Informed decisions**: Evidence-backed choices rather than guesswork
- **Context-aware recommendations**: Solutions that fit your codebase, team, and constraints
- **Risk mitigation**: Understanding limitations and failure modes before implementation
- **Knowledge building**: Deep understanding that informs future decisions

## Decision-Making Framework

**Purpose:** Transform research into actionable decisions for your codebase.

### How Research Enables Decisions

**Step 1: Gather Diverse Perspectives**
- Collect 5+ evidence cards covering different approaches
- Include conflicting ideas, not just best practices
- Mix academic rigor (high weight) with practical insights (lower weight but valuable)

**Step 2: Weight Evidence Systematically**
- Academic papers: Weight by citations (50+ = high, 10-50 = medium, <10 = lower but may be relevant)
- Non-academic sources: Weight by recency, authority, and practical value
- Multiple sources agreeing = higher confidence
- Your codebase context = determines which evidence matters most

**Step 3: Critical Evaluation**
- Assess each approach's strengths and weaknesses
- Evaluate fit for your codebase architecture and constraints
- Compare tradeoffs systematically
- Identify which approach works best for your specific context

**Step 4: Synthesize into Decisions**
- Identify core conflicts and when each approach applies
- Weight evidence to determine strongest recommendations
- Provide context-dependent guidance (primary + alternatives)
- Deliver actionable next steps for implementation
