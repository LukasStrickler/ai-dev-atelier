## Research Question / Problem Statement

{What is the research question or problem you're trying to solve? This should be informed by the codebase context above.

Examples:
- "What architecture should we use for X given our current microservices setup?"
- "How does Y work and how can we integrate it with our existing Node.js stack?"
- "How to make Z compatible with our current PostgreSQL database?"
- "Which approach is best for our specific use case considering our current patterns?"}

## Context / Background

Include:
- Current situation (reference codebase context)
- Why this research is needed
- What decisions need to be made
- Any relevant constraints or requirements from codebase}

## Desired Outcome

{What do you want to achieve with this research?

Examples:
- "Understand different approaches to X"
