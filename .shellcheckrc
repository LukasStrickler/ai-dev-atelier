# Shellcheck configuration for ai-dev-atelier
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/optional

# Enable external sources (for sourced files)
external-sources=true

# Shell dialect
shell=bash

# Disable specific checks that are intentional patterns in this codebase:

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source (dynamic sourcing is used)
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file (may not exist at lint time)
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused (lib scripts export variables for sourcing)
disable=SC2034



# SC2181: Check exit code directly with if mycmd; instead of $?
# (Common pattern for clarity in complex conditional checks)
disable=SC2181

# SC2001: See if you can use ${variable//search/replace} instead of sed
# (sed is often clearer for complex patterns)
disable=SC2001

# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes
# (Intentional for jq queries and JSON templates)
disable=SC2016



# SC2064: Use single quotes for trap, otherwise expands now
# (Intentional in some cases to capture current values)
disable=SC2064

# SC2126: Consider using grep -c instead of grep|wc -l
# (Style preference, both work correctly)
disable=SC2126

# SC2009: Consider using pgrep instead of grepping ps output
# (pgrep not always available or suitable for complex patterns)
disable=SC2009

# SC2012: Use find instead of ls
# (ls is sufficient for simple directory listings)
disable=SC2012

# SC2010: Don't use ls | grep
# (Acceptable for simple filtering)
disable=SC2010

# SC2129: Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file
# (Style preference)
disable=SC2129



# SC2000: See if you can use ${#variable} instead
# (Style preference)
disable=SC2000

# SC2005: Useless echo
# (Sometimes needed for subshell output)
disable=SC2005

# SC2018/SC2019: Use [:lower:]/[:upper:] for accents
# (Not needed for this codebase - ASCII only)
disable=SC2018
disable=SC2019

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# (Style preference - inline assignment is intentional for readability)
disable=SC2155

# SC2329: Function never invoked
# (Error handler is triggered by trap, not direct invocation)
disable=SC2329

# SC2317: Command appears to be unreachable
# (Error handler is triggered by trap, not direct invocation)
disable=SC2317

# SC2162: read without -r will mangle backslashes
# (Not needed for PR numbers and simple confirmations)
disable=SC2162

# SC2295: Expansions inside ${..} need to be quoted separately
# (Low risk pattern)
disable=SC2295
